I am young cybercock from the cold north trying to learn cybersecurity and other arts.

My interests are:

- Cybersecurity
- Philosophy & Literature
- Linguistics 
- Psychology & Neuroscience

As for this page, I intend for it to be a way for documenting and journaling. Also as an outlet for when the energy was to go somewhere.


And btw everthing on this page is WIP
